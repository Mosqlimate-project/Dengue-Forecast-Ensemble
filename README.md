# Dengue-Forecast-Ensemble
# 2024 Infodengue Sprint: Dengue Fever Predictive Modeling in Brazil
This is a dengue ensemble forecast model designed to work with models from the 2024 Infodengue sprint. This initiative is led by the Mosqlimate project, in collaboration with the Harmonize and IDExtremes projects.

# Background
The year 2024 has seen an exceptional number of reported dengue fever cases in various parts of the world. In Brazil, the disease has spread to new areas in the south and at altitudes where epidemics were not previously recorded, or or reemerging in areas whose control programs had already eradicated them, with an incidence rate has far exceeding that of previous years. The objective of this sprint, therefore, is to promote, in a standardized way, the training of predictive models with the aim of developing an ensemble forecast for dengue in Brazil.

# The chalenge methodology 
The challenge had two test goals and a forecast goal, described below. 

Validation test 1. Predict the weekly number of dengue cases by state (UF) in the 2022-2023 season [EW 41 2022- EW40 2023], using data covering the period from EW 01 2010 to EW 25 2022;

Validation test 2. Predict the weekly number of dengue cases by state (UF) in the 2023-2024 season [EW 41 2023- EW40 2024], using data covering the period from EW 01 2010 to EW 25 2023;

Forecast target. Predict the weekly number of dengue cases in Brazil, and by state (UF), in the 2024-2025 season [EW 41 2024- EW40 2025], using data covering the period from EW 01 2010 to EW 25 2024;

The date range of interest comprised a period between epidemiological week (EW) 41 of one year and EW 40 of the following year, which corresponds to a typical dengue season in Brazil. Participants were encouraged to generate results for all 27 federative units in Brazil or, optionally, they could also generate results for a minimum set of states that represented all regions of Brazil, namely: North: Amazonas (AM), Northeast: Ceará (CE ), Midwest: Goiás (GO), Southeast: Minas Gerais (MG), South: Paraná (PR)

The following outcomes should be provided by the models, both with point estimates and predictive intervals of 90%: (i) Curve of dengue cases by EW for the 2022-2023 and 2023-2024 seasons and (ii) accumulated number of cases probable cases of dengue fever for UF in the 2022-2023 and 2023-2024 seasons

The training data sets and their respective variable dictionary were made available on the Mosqlimate platform. In generalthe dataset contained epidemiological, demographic, climate, miscellaneous and environmental data. Other data sources indicated by the participants themselves were shared on the same platform since they followed the same characteristics of the platform data: open access, updatable and available to all Brazilian states.

All information to make the developed models available was published in the repository https://github.com/Mosqlimate-project/sprint-template
